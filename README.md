# ShadowDOM Example

As part of Automation 360 v.34 release, the ShadowDOM web standard is now supported in the Recorder package from version 3.3.1-20241001-095119.

For developers, this release supports object-based automation of modern web application (for example, ServiceNow, Salesforce) components that use the ShadowDOM standard. Universal Recorder powered automation provides a streamlined user experience and minimizes the risk of automation failures in such applications. Newly introduced CSS selectors will also improve the reliability of all types of web-based automation.

This webpage, accessible at: [https://automationanywhere.github.io/shadowdom-example/](https://automationanywhere.github.io/shadowdom-example/) allows you test out your package against some elements in the ShadowDOM.
